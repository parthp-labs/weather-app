# Weather App 🌤️

A lightweight, responsive **Weather Application** built using **vanilla JavaScript** with a small **Express backend** to securely handle API requests.  
It displays real-time weather data, forecasts, and key highlights for any searched city or your current location.

> **Note:** This project started as a learning exercise and was later refined, documented, and deployed as a portfolio project.
